## What is Rehook?

Rehook offers a curated collection of custom hooks designed to streamline your development process by eliminating the need to repeatedly implement the same hooks across different projects. With Rehook, all it takes is a simple copy, paste, and customization to enhance your projects effortlessly.

<b>It's not a library or a package to install.</b>

##  Get Started

Jhon: In my React project , I want a ready-to-use hook for handling cookies but I would change it later.

Me: OKAY. Just copy and paste `useCookie` hook from [use-cookie](https://github.com/alamenai/rehook/blob/main/src/hooks/use-cookie.ts) and do your changes. That's it!

For more hooks just browse the [hooks](https://github.com/alamenai/rehook/tree/main/src/hooks) folder.
